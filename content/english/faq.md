  >   >   > * To do so you must contact us saying you wish to cancel and also provide your order number.
  >   > * Beyond three days you might not receive any refund for the month in which the subscription was originally purchased. We encourage you to contact us anyway and hopefully we can work something out.
  >   > * If you decide to cancel your subscription before the next billing cycle, you will retain our services for the duration of the paid for billing cycle. For the following billing cycle, you will no longer be charged and the services previously purchased from Osows will cease.
  >   >   > * Any negotiated refund will be based on the amount of days since your original purchase and the labor already spent.
  >   >   > * In most cases, however, you will not receive any refund beyond the three day mark.

  >   > * You will receive a 100% refund if you cancel your plan within three days of the original purchase.

  >   > * If you decide to cancel your subscription before the end of the annual billing cycle, you will receive our services until said billing cycle ends. For the following billing cycle, you will no longer be charged and the services previously purchased from Osows will cease. If you have questions regarding the status of the website purchased from us after your subscription ends, see our [Subscription Policy](../)(coming soon...) page for more details.
  >   > * If you have purchased the Professionally Coded Website on the monthly billing cycle, you are not allowed to cancel until the end of approximately one year of monthly billing cycles. This is because the cost of the website is the accumulation of one year's worth of monthly payments. If you decide to cancel, please contact us and we will tell you the date your subscription will end and when our services will cease (i.e. after one full year (12 months) of billing cycles have been completed).
