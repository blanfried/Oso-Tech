<br/>We strive for **Accessibility** on two fronts:
<br/>
<br/>    - Access to a professional website for small business owners at a price they can afford.
<br/>
<br/>    - Access to all disabled individuals so they, just like anyone else, can enjoy the services our clients have to offer.

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>Our goal is to give small business owners the **Opportunity** to have easier, safer, and better lives:
<br/>
<br/>    - Easier: We take care of all their website needs for them.
<br/>
<br/>    - Safer: We take every measure to minimize litigation on all fronts.
<br/>
<br/>    - Better: We optimize our sites to ensure their revenue will explode.

    content : "<br/>How do we achieve **Simplicity**?
<br/>
<br/>    - **Static Sites:** Using coding languages like Hugo and third-party integrations like Stripe we create static sites with dynamic capability. This allows our sites to consistently outperform Wordpress, Shopify, Wix, and other CMS platforms.
<br/>
<br/>    - **Clean Designs:** A clean design shows the user what you do and why they should choose you without them having to weed through so much fluff.
<br/>
<br/>    - **Intuitive Interactions:** Call us! Email us! We are human and we answer or respond with lightning speed, transparency, and fun throughout the whole process. "
