  title : "Professionally Coded Website"
  content : "
<br/> Website Builders like Shopify, Wordpress, Wix, etc. have a lot of extra code. Whilst this code makes it easy to build a website, the website built from it is slowed down for the user.
<br/>
<br/> We achieve maximum SEO and performance using static websites with dynamic capabilities. This means our sites are lean. They load rapidly and do not lack capability.
<br/>
<br/> Therefore, with Osows your custom website will be blazing fast. Google will favor it and your users will love it, thus leading to exponential conversion rates and a massive boost in revenue over time.
