  title : "Devoted to Small Businesses"
  content : "
<br/>Being one ourselves, we understand the stress and tribulations a small business has to go through. We are just lucky that we know how to code and all the legal matters that go into a website. Most small businesses are not so lucky and have hardly any time to put into this area.<br/>

<br/>It is for this reason that we are devoted to small business. We know what they need to survive and thrive in a protected manner. Not only this, but we empathize with small businesses and therefore provide reasonable prices and consistent customer service.<br/>

<br/>If you choose Osows, your revenue will increase, you will never need to worry about your website again, and you will have consistent IT support.

    content : "<br/>How do we achieve **Simplicity**?
<br/>
<br/>    - **Static Sites:** Using coding languages like Hugo and third-party integrations like Stripe we create static sites with dynamic capability. This allows our sites to consistently outperform Wordpress, Shopify, Wix, and other CMS platforms.
<br/>
<br/>    - **Clean Designs:** A clean design shows the user what you do and why they should choose you without them having to weed through so much fluff.
<br/>
<br/>    - **Intuitive Interactions:** Call us! Email us! We are human and we answer or respond with lightning speed, transparency, and fun throughout the whole process. "
