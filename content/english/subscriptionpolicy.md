## What This Document Covers
Upon payment for an Osows Subscription, and thereby agreeing with our Terms of Service, you also agree to the terms laid out in this Subscription Policy.

These terms, developed below, cover our ["**Professionally Coded Website Policy**"](#1-professionally-coded-website), ["**Website Management Policy**"](#2-website-management), ["**Refunds and Cancellation Policy**"](#8-refunds-and-cancellation), as well as any additional purchases that may be added onto the original Subscription purchase and the terms which go along with each additional purchase. By "Subscription" it is meant the original Osows [**"Professionally Coded Website"**](#1-professionally-coded-website) Subscription, which is the base of all other additional subscriptions or add-ons. In order to purchase additional subscriptions, like [**"Website Management"**](#2-website-management) or add-ons, one must have either paid for the Subscription "in Full" (see section 1) or currently be on or finished with the "one year payment plan" regarding the Subscription (see section 1). An "add-on" is an addition to the Subscription and constitutes a *one-time purchase* (i.e., not a recurring payment, unless coupled with the one year payment plan for the Subscription, by which the payment ceases at the end of the one year cycle along with the subscription itself). Examples of add-ons could include ["**Additional Pages**"](#4-additional-pages), ["**Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Pages**"](#6-creation-of-terms-of-service-and-privacy-policy), or the ["**Initial Blog Page**"](#5-blogs). An "additional subscription" is any subscription other than the Subscription. Additional subscriptions constitute a *recurring payment* over an indefinite period of time (i.e., not confined to the scope of the Subscription under a one year payment plan). Examples of additional subscriptions are [**"Website Management"**](#2-website-management), ["**Accessibility Compliance**"](#9-accessibility-compliance) or [**"Blog Posting"**](#5-blogs).

  >   > * If you have purchased the Professionally Coded Website on the monthly billing cycle, you are not allowed to cancel until the end of approximately one year of monthly billing cycles. This is because the cost of the website is the accumulation of one year's worth of monthly payments. If you decide to cancel, please contact us and we will tell you the date your subscription will end and when our services will cease (i.e. after one full year (12 months) of billing cycles have been completed).
